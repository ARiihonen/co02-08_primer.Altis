An enforcer of the Kalochori Falcons, a prominent local crime syndicate, is holding a stolen HDD containing information on several large caches of hidden wartime high explosives. The drive is encrypted and unlikely to have been breached yet. Your mission is to enter <marker name = 'marker_ao'>an unfinished commercial complex</marker> serving as a base for several different gangs, and to retrieve the drive using whatever means necessary.
<br /> <br />
The target is likely to move around between <marker name = %1>these</marker>%2<marker name = %3>buildings</marker>, which the Falcons consider their territory. The drive is equipped with a GPS locator, which has been visible to our sensors since it was transferred to him. It will be possible to track the target's location through your GPS device, as well as through your helicopter's camera.
<br /> <br />
You are set up <marker name = 'respawn'>at the prep point</marker>. Retrieve the HDD, and extract from <marker name = 'marker_ao'>the area</marker>.
